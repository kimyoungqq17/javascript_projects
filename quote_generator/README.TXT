To bypass the below error message:

Access to fetch at 'http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&lang=en&format=json' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.


I used a chrome extension "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
